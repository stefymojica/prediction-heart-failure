# Heart Failure Prediction

This project aims to predict heart failure. Additionally, a Bayesian generative model will be implemented to generate more data based on real-world data. Finally, a graphical user interface (GUI) will be created to demonstrate the interaction with the machine learning model.

## Key Topics
- [Bayesian model](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/stable/learn.html)
- [Neural network models (supervised)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html)
- [Dash Framework](https://dash.plotly.com/)
- [CSS basic](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS)

## Setup

Follow these steps to get this set up:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stefymojica/prediction-heart-failure.git
cd prediction-heart-failure
```

## Exercises

You'll find all the **exercises** in the exercise directory. 
The final version of the project is located in the **src folder** and the final UI is in the **app.py file**

## Running app

```sh
# to run exercise version app
python3 exercise/app.py
```

```sh
# to run final version app
python3 app.py
```
